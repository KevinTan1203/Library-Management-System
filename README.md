## About

This project focuses on developing a mini online library management system.

## Details
_This project is part of the module BT2102: Data Management and Visualisation Assignment 1, where students are tasked to create a Library Database Management System using Python, MySQL and MongoDB_

Users are able to login/create an account with this digital library interface. Once the user is in, he/she can browse through the collection of books, as well as perform simple/advance search operations on the available books. On top of that, they can borrow/return books using a borrow/return function within the main interface, view outstanding fines as well as extend an existing loan on a book.

Meanwhile, Admins can also search for users, and retrieve information such as users who have outstanding fines to be paid, as well as the availability of books in the database.

The Logical and Conceptual Data Model can be found in the Group 18 Assignment_1.pptx file
